# Capsule

##How it Works
1. Add articles of clothing
  * set type (top, bottom, outerwear, dress, details, shoes)
  * set weather (cool, warm, both)
  * upload photo
2. Create outfits out of articles of clothing
  * manually select articles
  * randomly generate outfit
3. Make a capsule plan
  * set target amounts for each article type
  * compare plan amounts to actual amounts
